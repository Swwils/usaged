NOTE TO TECH REVIEWERS:
This is a hacked-together thing that is not intended to be a good example of coding style, separation of concerns etc.  This is not a good example of my coding ability, it is simply a stopgap.
The same goes for most of my github, it's full of hackday projects, proofs of concept and back burner projects that will never go anywhere and I would not put into anything considered "production".
